Hi there!

The IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit is a foundational level professional certification for gauging proficiency in using IBM's Qiskit SDK for quantum computation tasks. Achieving this was an integral part of the IBM Qiskit Advocate application, 2021.

Officially, the description states that: _"An IBM Qiskit Developer is an individual who understands fundamental quantum computing concepts and is able to express them using the Qiskit open source software development kit (SDK). They have experience using the Qiskit SDK from the python programming language to create and execute quantum computing programs on IBM Quantum computers and simulators. This individual is able to perform these tasks with little to no assistance from product documentation."_

I've earned a badge for this! <https://www.credly.com/badges/a5acaaa8-446f-425c-8f22-e230cec8f843/public_url>.

The remotely administered test was fully proctored, with no reference material, and conducted by Pearson VUE.

The badge is undoubtedly an amazing, concrete outcome. In addition, I immensely value the knowledge that I gained by preparing for it. Exploring how to write a custom provider for interfacing a quantum computer with Qiskit, going through the multitude of options in `qiskit.execute`, and dabbling in qasm and the `qiskit.quantum_info` modules was enriching.
