Hi there!

It is a pleasure to announce that I have been selected as one of the mentees for the highly regarded QOSF Mentorship program!

According to the official description (see the [website](<https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship>), the program was set up to guide _"people from diverse backgrounds who want to learn more about quantum computing ... by pairing them with mentors ... to help them overcome these hurdles and create interesting projects"._ The mentors are experts who are well experienced in quantum computing and belong to industry or academia.

Out of around 800 applications from around the world, of people with varying levels of experience, I am one of the 40 candidates selected as a project mentee (i.e. a protege).

The screening consisted of submitting my CV and expressing my motivation for this program and quantum computing. Prior experience with software was considered a boost. In addition, the most challenging (and gratifying) part of the screening was to solve one of the screening tasks. The organizers specified a set of "homework tasks", out of which I attempted the task to build a quantum simulator from scratch. The minimum, high-level functionality required was to initialize a state, read an input quantum program, calculate the matrix operator and to apply it on to the state.

Working on the screening task solution was a fun filled period of learning spanning two weeks, in which I built a simulator for quantum computations using python. It is called SIQCANDAR - Simulator of Quantum Computations for Amateurs, Novices, Developers And Researchers. The name is inspired by the Persian version of the name of Alexander the Great. My solution has the capability to simulate single qubit gates, multi-qubit gates, controlled gates and parametric gates. Further, it has various visualization features, like plotting histogram of measurement outcomes, state phase visualization etc. I also implemented multi-shot measurement using a random sampler based on the probability mass function of the output quantum state, to simulate random sampling outcomes. Whatâ€™s more, I implemented a simple circuit drawer using turtle!

To me, the highlight of this submission were the multiple tests I added to verify the functionality of the simulator. These were very helpful in uncovering some important bugs.

My selected submission can be found on github here: [dhruvbhq/qosf_appl_feb_2021_work](<https://github.com/dhruvbhq/qosf_appl_feb_2021_work>)

I'm very grateful for this opprtunity, and I look forward to work with my mentor, Dr Amandeep Singh Bhatia.
